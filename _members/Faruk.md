Faruk Dube is a PhD in Biomedical Sciences with a background in parasitology, bacteriology, and virology. He has been working at SciLifeLab (Uppsala University) as a postdoctoral researcher since March 2024. His current research leverages machine learning models to identify vaginal microbiome configurations linked to reproductive health, utilizes multilocus phylogenomics to determine phylogenetic placement of key vaginal symbionts, and benchmarks viral profiling tools to analyze virome-microbiome dynamics in vaginal and infant gut samples.
